**Integrated Tests Example (Component Interaction Testing):**

In integrated testing, you focus on testing how different components or modules of the system work together as a whole. These tests check if the interactions between components are correct and that the system functions as expected when these components interact.

For example, you might create an integrated test suite that covers a user registration and notification system. In this case, you would write tests that:

- Simulate user registration.
- Simulate sending a notification.
- Simulate a user viewing and interacting with their notifications.
- Here's a simplified example of how integrated tests might look for such a scenario:


`class UserRegistrationAndNotificationIntegrationTest(TestCase):`
Simulate user registration
    `def test_user_registration_and_notification_flow(self):`
```python
        self.client.post(reverse('register'), data={'username': 'testuser', 'password': 'testpassword'})
```

Simulate sending a notification
```python
        self.client.post(reverse('send_notification'), data={'recipient': 'testuser', 'message': 'Test notification'})
```

Simulate user viewing notifications
```python
        response = self.client.get(reverse('view_notifications', args=['testuser']))
```

Check if the notification is visible and can be interacted with
```python
        self.assertContains(response, 'Test notification')
```
Then, add more assertions as needed for interaction testing
